This Python Tic-Tac-Toe game is a classic two-player experience designed for the terminal. It features an intuitive 3x3 grid where players alternate placing 'X' and 'O' to achieve three in a rowâ€”horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game continuously updates the board and checks for wins or draws after each move. Players input their moves by choosing a number from 1 to 9, corresponding to board positions. With simple text-based interaction and clear win/draw messages, this Python implementation provides a straightforward and engaging way to enjoy Tic-Tac-Toe directly from the command line.<br>
